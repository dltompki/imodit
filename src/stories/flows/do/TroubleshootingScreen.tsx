            1. You Forgot to Remove the Shipping Blocks
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            Some new struts and coilovers come with plastic or rubber spacers to
            prevent movement during shipping. If you didnâ€™t remove these, your
            suspension is effectively locked in place.

        </Box>

          <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>
            2. You Bought the Wrong Parts
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            Are you sure you got the right shocks and springs for your car? If
            you installed heavy-duty truck shocks on your sedan, or vice versa,
            your suspension might be completely out of spec.

          <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>
            3. You Installed Coil Springs Incorrectly
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            If your car uses coil springs, did you seat them properly in their
            perches? Misaligned springs can lock up the suspension, leading to a
            rough ride.
